// uncomment "OUTPUT_READABLE_REALACCEL" if you want to see acceleration

// compensated for orientation, us OUTPUT_READABLE_WORLDACCEL instead.

// uncomment "OUTPUT_READABLE_WORLDACCEL" if you want to see acceleration
// components with gravity removed and adjusted for the world frame of
// reference (yaw is relative to initial orientation, since no magnetometer
// is present in this case). Could be quite handy in some cases.
